     * the objective of this method is to discriminate (or order) compatible values, and return only
     * the best ones.
     *
     * The result of the selection process is going to depend on the result of this method: if it
     * returns a single value, then there's a clear winner. If it returns more than one value, then
     * it means that they are equivalent and that the strategy cannot discriminate between them.
     *
     * The result of this operation is never empty: since the map we pass only contains compatible
     * values, it is an error to say that there's no best match in that list. Similarly, it is
     * an error to return a value which is not contained in the key set of the candidates map.
     *
     * There are 3 possibilities for the provided value: it can be present, missing or unknown.
     * A present value is the normal case, when the consumer provides a value. A missing value
     * is possible when the consumer knows about an attribute but doesn't care about providing
     * a value. Last, an unknown value is when the consumer didn't provide a value and doesn't know
     * about the attribute. This would be the case when the producer has more attributes than the
     * consumer, and the consumer doesn't know about the extra attributes.
     *
     * The {@link AttributeValue requested value} provides handy method for dealing with those 3
     * cases if you want to.
     *
     * @param requestedValue the value to compare against. Never null.
     * @param compatibleValues the map of candidate values
     * @param <K> the type of the candidate
     * @return a list of best matches. Must never be empty.
